# softuni-exam Products Product showcase site

This is the repository for my Products showcase site for the sotuni course final exam.

There is no DataBase added to the repository, so you will need to create on when installing the project.

Steps to install are:
- Pull the project from Github
- Set-up wp-config.php
- Create a new DB
- Activate the "Products Plugin" plugin
- Activate the "Products" theme
